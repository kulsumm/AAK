Project Description

This project analyzes air quality data in California using a dataset that records daily PM2.5 concentration levels. The goal is to explore the data, sort and filter it based on different conditions, categorize air quality levels, and find the most polluted regions.
	•	Step 1: We loaded the dataset and displayed the first few rows to understand its structure.
	•	Step 2: We sorted the data by PM2.5 concentration (to find the worst air quality days) and by region name (to group data).
	•	Step 3: We filtered rows where PM2.5 was above 50 µg/m³ and extracted data for Fresno, then calculated Fresno’s average PM2.5 concentration.
	•	Step 4: We added a column categorizing air quality as “Good,” “Moderate,” or “Unhealthy.” Then, we calculated the percentage of days in each category for Fresno.
	•	Step 5: We found the top 3 most polluted regions by calculating the average PM2.5 concentration for each region.
